# Breathline Breathing for Relaxation - Autism Friendly

I made this app to help someone with severe autism to have a calmer mind.

Breathe along with the car :).

If you struggle to meditate, or explain meditation to someone, try this app.

Breathe in as the car goes up a hill, breathe out when the car goes down a hill.
