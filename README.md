# Breathline Breathing for Relaxation - Autism Friendly

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dd7b27-18be-4134-9978-7b151bb06910

I made this app to help those with severe autism to have a calmer mind.

Breathe along as the car goes up and down hills ðŸ˜Š.

If you struggle to meditate, or explaining meditation to someone, try this app.

Breathe in as the car goes up a hill, breathe out when the car goes down a hill.
