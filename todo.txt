Fix the bug where the car doesn't go all the way to the end

Make the level start look better.
	Preload trees and clouds on level start.

add a finishline to the game
or a house/garage the car drives in to

Make the animation smoother
	Currently the way that it calculates what point to draw the car at is not 100% accurate and could be updated.
	I think I need to use linear interpolation to calculate the point between two points properly.
	Learn the maths for linear interpolation.
